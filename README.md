# Arris
A New Custom Array based Language.
It is a mix of -> C, Assembly, AOL (Custom), and more

# Types of memory available in Arris
Arris is made in python so direct memory manipulation of the program memory is impossible but to counter that, arris programs are given their own program memory space virtually inside of the python program space.

## Heap
Arris does support heap!

## Stack
Arris also supports stack!
